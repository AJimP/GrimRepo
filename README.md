# Project 2: Grim Repo

## Description

This is Adrian Jimenez, Kenan McKenzie, and Johan Herrera's Project 2 submission. 

For out project, we decided to create a card game based off of the horror game Inscryption. In order to achieve this we learning how to incorporate 3D models onto our page using three.js and animating them using GSAP. We set up a database to store the data for the cards, and data for our players so that we could later have a leaderboard. Once our database was ready, we were able to create login routes and authentication for our users to be able to play the game. After being able to authenticate users, we created custom made cards, and were able to construct the game visuals and game logic to allow for a truly interactive user experience. Once the game has ended, our database is called to store the highscore of the player, and when the user is on the leaderboards page, then we display all scores from top to bottom.
